# Frontend Architecture skill

A Claude Code skill providing folder structure and code organization rules for React + Next.js (App Router) projects.

## Version

**0.1.0** — initial release, 2026-06-20.

## Focus

This skill answers **"where do I put this file?"** questions for a React or Next.js codebase. It is intentionally narrow.

**In scope:**
- Top-level folder structure (`src/`, `app/`, `features/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `utils/`, …)
- Feature-based vs layer-based vs atomic design — when to use each
- Co-location of components, tests, styles, sub-components
- Where constants, types, utils, helpers, lib, services live (and why)
- Business-logic placement: hooks vs services vs `lib/`
- Component breakdown: when to split, where the sub-component goes, naming
- Next.js App Router specifics: private folders (`_components`), route groups (`(name)`), non-route code placement

**Out of scope:**
- React patterns and anti-patterns (see `react-best-practices`)
- Next.js runtime behavior — RSC boundaries, data patterns, runtime selection, bundling (see `next-best-practices`)
- Styling, testing, type-level programming (see dedicated skills)

## When this skill triggers

Phrases that should activate it (matched against the skill description):
- "where should I put X"
- "folder structure" / "project structure" / "directory structure"
- "how to organize my React/Next project"
- "utils vs helpers" / "utils vs lib"
- "where do constants go"
- "how to break this component down"
- "app router structure" / "private folders" / "route groups"

## Use cases

1. Setting up a new React or Next.js project
2. Refactoring a project that has outgrown its initial layout
3. Deciding the placement of a single new file
4. Reviewing a PR where files are added or moved
5. Settling a "where does this go" debate with concrete decision rules

## Relationship to other skills (no overlap)

| Skill | Focus | This skill differs by |
|---|---|---|
| `engineering-paved-path:react-best-practices` | Component design, hook rules, anti-patterns (derive-don't-store, render factories, memoization) | **No** patterns or anti-patterns; only file placement |
| `engineering-paved-path:next-best-practices` | RSC boundaries, data patterns, async APIs, metadata, bundling, runtime selection | **No** runtime / RSC semantics; only routing folder organization |
| `engineering-paved-path:react-testing-library` | RTL queries, async patterns, mocking | Not testing |
| `engineering-paved-path:typescript-expert` | Type-level programming, monorepo management | Not types |

If a question is purely about structure, this skill is primary. If it's a mix (e.g. "where do I put a server action and how does it work"), multiple skills may load — `frontend-architecture` answers *where*, `engineering-paved-path:next-best-practices` answers *how it runs*.

## Files

- `SKILL.md` — main rules with severity tags (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM). Loaded when the skill triggers.
- `examples.md` — concrete folder-tree examples (small Vite app, mid-size Next.js, bulletproof-react style). Loaded on demand.
- `README.md` — this file: meta, version, sources. Not loaded into Claude's context; reference for humans maintaining the skill.

## Maintenance

When updating the skill:
- Bump the `version` field in `SKILL.md` frontmatter and the **Version** section above
- Add a row to **Version history**
- Add any new sources used to the **Sources** section, preserving URL verbatim

### Conflicting opinions / open questions

(Material for future "trade-off" sections.)

- **Flat vs nested feature folders** — [Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-feature-architecture/) (peer-to-peer) vs [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) (strict layered) vs [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) (in between).
- **`utils/` vs `lib/` vs `helpers/`** — [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) uses both `lib/` and `utils/`; [Jack Franklin](https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/structuring-react-applications/) prefers a single `lib/`; [Ali Bey](https://medium.com/@a.m.housen/libs-vs-utils-vs-services-folders-simple-explanation-for-developers-0ae961539a0f) distinguishes three; the [erikras GH thread](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example/issues/808) shows no community consensus.
- **Barrel files (`index.ts`) — yes or no** — [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/) and [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) embrace; [Catch Metrics on Next.js barrel files](https://www.catchmetrics.io/blog/nextjs-bundle-size-improvements-optimize-your-performance), [vercel/next.js #92926](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/92926), [Next.js issue #12557](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/12557), and [Why I Will Not Use Index Files in 2025](https://medium.com/@aleksandr_ross/why-i-will-not-use-index-files-in-2025-b40db08dab00) document tree-shaking/Jest/build costs. Modern compromise: barrels only for **public** APIs of features.
- **Single `constants.ts` vs per-feature** — [Semaphore's constants-layer](https://semaphore.io/blog/constants-layer-javascript) (central) vs bulletproof-react and Wieruch (per-feature). Reconciliation: globally meaningful → central; feature-only → colocate.
- **Container/presentational still useful?** — [Dan Abramov's 2019 update](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) (hooks supersede it) vs [tsh.io](https://tsh.io/blog/container-presentational-pattern-react) and [Container Hook View Pattern](https://medium.com/@shaangontia/container-hook-view-pattern-react-14dc873eef78) (survives in modern form).
- **Data fetching location in App Router** — RSC pushes data fetching into `page.tsx`; [bulletproof-react's api-layer.md](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/api-layer.md) keeps an API layer + React Query. The two models conflict; in App Router, much of the client-side API layer becomes server-side data functions in `lib/` or colocated with the route.
